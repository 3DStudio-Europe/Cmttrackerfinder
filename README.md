Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-info-camera-capture.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd user-info-camera-capture
Serve the Application

Since accessing camera and location features requires HTTPS, you can use a simple HTTPS server like http-server with SSL.

Install http-server:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Serve with HTTPS:

bash
Copy code
http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem
Note: You'll need to generate SSL certificates (cert.pem and key.pem) or use a local development server that supports HTTPS.

Open in Browser

Navigate to https://localhost:8080 (or the port specified by your server) in your web browser.

Usage
Open the Application

Open the web application in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

Start the Process

Click the "Start" button to initiate device info display, geolocation retrieval, and camera access.

Grant Permissions

Device Info: Automatically displayed without permission.
Geolocation: The browser will prompt for permission to access your location.

Code Overview
HTML Structure: The index.html file contains the structure of the web page, including buttons and placeholders for displaying information.
Styles: Basic CSS styles are included within the <style> tags to format the video stream and canvas.
JavaScript Functionality:
Device Information: Retrieved using navigator.userAgent.
Geolocation: Accessed via navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition().
Camera Access: Implemented using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia().
Photo Capture: Utilizes a hidden <canvas> element to capture and process the image from the video stream.
Security and Privacy
User Consent: The application requests explicit permission before accessing location and camera.
Data Handling: No personal data is sent to a server in this implementation. All data stays within the user's browser.
HTTPS Requirement: Accessing camera and location features requires serving the application over HTTPS for security reasons.
Privacy Compliance: If modifying the application to send data to a server, ensure compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. Always inform users about data collection and usage.
